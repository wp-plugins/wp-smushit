Improve performance and get faster load times by optimizing image files with <a href="http://smush.it/">Smush.it</a> for WordPress – “It's the best plugin of its kind.”

== Description ==

WP Smush.it strips hidden, bulky information from your images, reducing the file size without losing quality. The faster your site loads, the more Google, Bing, Yahoo and other search engines will like it.

Heavy image files may be slowing down your site without you even knowing it. WP Smush.it meticulously scans every image you upload – or have already added to your site – and cuts all the unnecessary data for you.

== Upgrade Notice ==

In this first official release from WPMU DEV, we've done a code cleanup and reformat to get started, as well as  
attempting to handle smush.it API errors a bit better. We've also made all the text fully i18n translatable.

This will give us a good foundation to start adding some new features!
